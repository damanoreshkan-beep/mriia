# blackout — research & state map

A lane runner in an endless night city on afterdark's Mixamo cast (the Subway Surfers rework, 2026-09-13): she runs
by herself, a swipe moves her across four lanes, up jumps, down slides, coins on the way, the horde at her heels; a
meta layer); this file is the evidence the build stands on. The sections below Ф3 describe the joystick game this
replaced — kept for the numbers that still hold (assets, textures, pools, clips, the see pod).

## Ф3 — the lane runner (2026-09-13, Claude Fable 5.1)

Surfers (the chase camera high behind the runner, three lanes, coin lines and arcs over the low barriers, trains as
the lane blockers, the HUD = score + coins, nothing else) and two open Three.js lane runners, both read in full:

- **neon-rush** (`xnirajjatwer/neon-rush`, no licence, 2026-09) — `inputManager.js` (a swipe = the first axis past a
  threshold, ONE action per touch; keys ←→↑↓/WASD/Space), `player.js` (lane lerp `1 − e^(−13·dt)`, lean
  `−vx·0.05` clamped ±0.35, gravity −34 / jump 12.5, slide 0.62 s), `obstacleManager.js` (rows by pattern: vehicle ·
  dodge 1–2 lanes · uniform jump · uniform slide (chance 0.55 + 0.25·d) · mixed; safety net: never every lane a
  dodge), `collisionSystem.js` (**resolved by ACTION, never box maths**: `jump` safe only in the air above 0.32,
  `slide` only while sliding, `dodge` never — z window 0.85, x tolerance 1.05), `segmentManager.js` (40 m segments,
  130 m ahead, 18 behind, 1–3 rows by difficulty, coins on the open lanes between rows), `game.js` (speed 9 → 24 over
  1600 m).
- **jyoti-run** (`BIRAL0-0/jyoti-run`, no licence, 2026-09) — `Teacher.js` + `config.js TEACHER`: the chaser state
  machine with its fairness guards — appears/menaces at 5.5 behind after the 1st mistake, surges to 3.2 for 0.6 s,
  the 2nd mistake is the catch, −1 mistake per 150 clean metres, a catch needs ≤1.5 sustained 0.4 s, a lunge grace
  while mid-jump/slide; `Difficulty.js` (speed linear, spawn chance smoothstepped 500 → 1500 m).

Neither carries a licence, so nothing is copied verbatim: the MECHANICS and their numbers are ported into our own
files (`world.js rowStates` = spawnRow widened to four lanes; `stage.js` = player + collision; `world.js chase`
= the Teacher in metres behind the runner). What we set differently, and why:

| Ours | Theirs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| gravity −22, jump 7.4 → 1.24 m in 0.67 s | −34 / 12.5 → 2.3 m | a 0.6 m barrier needs 1.2 m; 2.3 m reads as flying |
| `jump` safe above y 0.35 | 0.32 | the same idea, our barrier is 0.6 m high |
| slide 0.75 s (the Running Slide clip fitted to 0.85 s) | 0.62 | the Mixamo clip's own slide phase |
| speed 6.5 → 15 m/s over 1500 m; a stumble dips to 0.45 and recovers in 1.1 s | 9 → 24 / one hit = death | one-hit death is the SS feel only with the inspector; we keep the two-stumble rule |
| the horde menaces at 5.2 m, surges to 2.3, grabs at 1.1; −1 mistake / 150 m | 5.5 / 3.2 / 1.5 / 150 | the camera sits 7.2 m behind: at 5.2 the zombies fill the frame's low edge, at 2.3 they are at her heels |
| rows 1–3 per 24 m chunk, 4 chunks ahead / 2 behind | 1–3 per 40 m, 130 m ahead | the chunk grammar the street already had |
| `dodge` = a dumpster or a car across the lane, at most 2 lanes | a full barrier, at most 2 of 3 | the props the street already ships |

the Blackout wall (behind the camera, it was never in frame), and **Rapier** — a lane runner has a flat floor and
resolves obstacles by action, so the physics engine (2.86 MB, `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat`) left with the joystick.
`dpad.js` is no longer imported.

**Clips added (the box, `pipeline/export-clips.mjs`, Mixamo API, 2026-09-13):** Running Slide `119710901` (47 KB),
Jogging Stumble `121450901` (48 KB), Zombie Running `104020901` (33 KB), Zombie Attack `102320906` (80 KB), Zombie
Idle `104110902` (65 KB, unused yet). A one-shot's `fitTo` sets its timeScale so the clip plays out inside the
move's window (jump 0.7 s, slide 0.85 s, stumble 0.9 s).

**A runner of your own (1000 coins).** The generator is `rt/genchar.js` — afterdark's two-job pipeline (prompt →
`/feed/image` k:2 portrait → `/feed/character` TRELLIS + Make-It-Animatable) promoted to the product's rt/ as
`makeGenerator({jobKey, $loading, $pct, $error, onDone, onFail})`; afterdark's `genchar.js` is now a 12-line binding.
The PHOTO path adds one hop: `POST /feed/vision {image, mode:"look"}` (edge `vision.js`, the `caps/vision.js`
cascade that existed since 2026-08-18 with no route: Gemini keyed rows → OVH Qwen2.5-VL, inline bytes only) answers
the English LOOK paragraph — gender/age impression, build, hair, clothing, footwear, accessories, **no identity** —
which then rides the words path unchanged. The coins leave the wallet when the job starts (`spend`) and come back
on any failure (`onFail` → `refund`); a resumed job that fails after a reload does not refund (it was charged in the
run that started it and the edge may still finish it). The wallet is the local `persistentAtom` the skins already
spend — a client-side price, like the skins (a server-authoritative wallet is a separate decision).

**State map (the run tab):** `data-state` idle | run | over · `data-phys` loading | ready | failed | skipped ·
`data-lane` 0…3 · `data-near` 0…1 (the horde's closeness — the red edge and the dimming) · `data-acts` (the verbs
counted, keys and swipes alike) · `data-dist` / `data-coins`. The skins tab: `[data-mine-grid]` (the create card
`[data-gen-open]` + my runners, each with `[data-remove]`), `[data-skin-grid]` (the cast), the sheet
`[data-gen-form]` with `[data-gen-mode]` words | photo, `[data-gen-prompt]` / the intake `Chooser`
(`[data-src-upload]`, `[data-src-camera]`) → `[data-gen-photo]`, `[data-gen-go]`, `[data-gen-progress]`,
`[data-gen-error]`.

API from the VPS (13 synonyms, 81 RUNNING Spaces) and four probes on the pods (`vps/hftts.mjs`, one prompt) gave
`/feed/sfx` (edge `sfx.js`, the voice route's shape, kind:"audio" on the browser workers):

| Space | hardware | probe | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fffiloni/audiogen` (Meta AudioGen) | bare ZeroGPU | 5 s WAV 160 KB in 15 s, "Submit" | leads — made for effects, no fields |
| `stabilityai/stable-audio-3` | bare ZeroGPU | 8 steps in 16 s, but 60 s of WAV (10.5 MB) | second — radio "Model" → Small SFX, "Duration" by label |
| `fffiloni/audioldm2-…-API` | bare ZeroGPU | 10 s WAV 320 KB in 23 s | tail |
| `artificialguybr/Stable-Audio-Open-Zero` | duration=120 | "ZeroGPU worker error RuntimeError" | dropped |
| `OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-SoundEffect-v2.0` | duration=180 | never admitted anonymously | dropped |
| `Wubble-AI/…-v1` | cpu-basic | answered nothing twice | dropped |

The library (`docs/research/sfx-tools/sfxraw.mjs` inside the edge container → `sfxpack.mjs` → `assets/sfx-*.mp3`,
mono 44.1 kHz VBR, 26 → 25 effects, 630 KB): AudioGen answered every prompt at exactly 5.00 s (its duration slider
steps 5/10, the 10 s asks came back 5 s), one bucket per pod per 1–2 effects (the first batch lost 22 of 26 to a
refusal each; detached with 25 s pauses it took 105 s for 22). One trap: two prompts on two pods came back byte-identical
(`heartbeat` = `lamp-hum`, md5 ea96f57b) — a re-run with a reworded prompt replaced it; check md5 before shipping.
Measured (ffmpeg volumedetect): means −6 … −24 dB, so the mix lives in `SFX` gains (land −6.7 dB → 0.6, coin −24 dB
→ 0.5); one-shots trimmed with a 0.15 s fade (jump 1.2 s, land 1.0 s, hits 1.2–1.6 s), beds kept whole to loop.

The engine (`sound.js`): one Web Audio graph from the core's `createEngine`; effects are `AudioBufferSource`s with a
±spread on `playbackRate`; beds (steps, wind, lamp hum, the horde's moans and running, the heartbeat) are looping
sources whose gains follow the run every frame (`bedTo`: the steps' rate = speed / 4.4, the horde = 0.25 + near·0.75,
the heartbeat from near 0.45). THE MUSIC is afterdark's station, the direct Icecast feed (CORS-open, so the analyser
hears it — afterdark's own fallback path; the DVR/hls.js path is not needed to run, so it is not here), into the same
context; two analysers as in afterdark (smoothed → `bassEnergy`/`stepPulse`, raw → `spectralFlux`/`stepBeat` from
`rt/afterbeat.js`); `beat.phase` (latency-led) drives `world.pulse(1 − phase)` — every lamp head, cone and pool shares
one material, so the street flashes on the kick. The Run tap is the gesture: `ctx.resume`, the library loads, the
stream starts. No audio under the gate (`createEngine` returns null); the mute key in the HUD (`[data-mute]`) holds
`blackout:muted`.

**Not measured yet (UNVERIFIED until the S25):** whether the Icecast stream plays inside the WebView APK (afterdark
plays it in Chrome; the shell's WebView is the open question), the beat lock time on the phone (afterdark measures
~4–8 s), and real fps of the horde (10–12 skinned clones + the street) —
`report("stage.fps")` at frame 720, `bash vps/logs.sh blackout`; the swipe threshold (40 px) on a 6.9" screen; whether
the Zombie Running clip's timeScale (0.6 … speed/6) reads as a chase at 15 m/s.

## Ф2 — the premium street (2026-09-13, Claude Fable 5.1; measured on the box: dev `?live`, own headless Chromium/SwiftShader)

- **Props are Kenney CC0** (Car Kit + City Kit Roads/Suburban, kenney.nl zips): sedan, taxi, suv, van, hatchback-sports,
  dumpster (×4), light-curved (×7), construction-barrier (×8), planter (×3.2), construction-cone (×8) merged into ONE
  draco GLB `assets/props.glb` (67 KB, 3 palette textures) by `~/mixamo-library/pipeline/_props.mjs` (gltf-transform:
  flatten+join per model → wrapper node = the prop name → mergeDocuments → unpartition → dedup → webp 512 → draco).
  **Name the merged scene** (`setName("props")`): GLTFLoader uniquifies node names, and a scene named "sedan" turned
  the sedan wrapper into `sedan_1` — `P[kind]` undefined, `.size` TypeError in `car()`.
- **Textures are Z-Image (zimg, 1024², "seamless tileable … orthographic")** → webp `assets/tex-*.webp` (FLAT: `deploy/build.mjs` copies only top-level files of `assets/`, a `textures/` subdir 404s on prod — measured after the first deploy): facade (dark
  brick, 96 KB) + graffiti (269 KB) + asphalt (275 KB) + sidewalk (paving slabs, 2 m tiles on the kerb top) + metal
  (512², 12 KB). The HF guest quota ran dry mid-batch — a retry loop with 90–240 s backoff got every prompt through.
  Seams: `MirroredRepeatWrapping` — free and invisible.
  The facade is composed at boot: brick photo + a 3×3 window grid per 9 m tile drawn on a canvas (two seeded variants),
  the glow map holds only the lit windows. Buildings scale their box UVs per face (`buildingGeo`) — one material per
  chunk per variant, NO texture clones (a 1024² clone per building = a GPU upload each).
- **Instance pools** (`pool()`): one InstancedMesh per prop kind, a free-list of slots, free slots parked at scale 0,
  `count` = highest slot in use (SwiftShader halved its frame time when every zero-scale instance stopped running
  the vertex shader: 1.5 → 3 fps). Per-instance colour = the lamp head/beam/pool dimming when the Blackout passes.
- **The huge Rapier ground was sinking the capsule 0.14 m** (`cuboid(10, 0.1, 100000)`, HEAD measured −0.14 on flat
  road, −0.26 further in). Per-chunk 24 m road cuboids (chunk 0 + 8 m start pad) → feet at 0.02. World owns the road.
- **Vault through a car proven** (`scratchpad/drive.mjs`: seed 35, sedan across lane 0 at z −54.2, d 1.5): feet
  0.02 → 1.58 over the roof, down past it, still running, 4 arc coins. Lane cars sit ACROSS (d 1.5) — a lengthwise
  car (d 2.6) can't be cleared from the 1.5 m trigger at JUMP_V 5.3 (y 0.69 at the rear edge). Kerb cars are
  lengthwise side obstacles with a crate-height AABB (1.05). (On the sunken ground the same run peaked at 2.5 m —
  grounded flipped true on the roof and re-fired the vault; with the per-chunk road it is one clean arc.)
- **NPCs** = afterdark's cast (michelle/sophie/eve/nightshade + bundled arissa) via `SkeletonUtils.clone`, one mixer
  each, the breathing idle (75 %) or Quake (`../afterdark/assets/move-108780901.glb`, when reachable), hidden past
  55 m. Dev serves only `apps/blackout/` → in dev only arissa spawns; prod is same-origin. A failed skin is skipped.
- `rig.js` = hipsOf / fit / retarget shared by stage and world (was inline in stage).
- SwiftShader here: ~2 fps at 420×860 full scene (fill-bound: 1024² textures + additive beams); physics tests ran at
  200×400 with the eye candy hidden (6 fps). Real fps = the S25 via `report("stage.fps")`.

## Ф1 — the game (2026-09-13, Claude Fable 5.1; measured on the box: dev server `?live`, Chromium/SwiftShader)

- **Shipped:** `state.js` (skins, wallet, record, live-run atoms; gate = a fixed mid-run frame) · `world.js` (24 m
  chunks, 4 ahead / 2 behind: lit facades from one canvas texture, kerbs, lamps, phrases of step / crate / barrier /
  bin + coin lines and arcs, density by distance; the Blackout wall + ground tongue, chunks it passes lose their
  emissive) · `stage.js` (Rapier controller + autostep, the vault = `JUMP_V` when a crate is within 1.5 m, coins and
  punch targets are plain AABBs — no sensors, no `ActiveCollisionTypes` question; follow camera settles behind the
  heading 1.8 s after the last drag; the dark dims the lights within 25 m) · `view.js` (floating joystick left, orbit
  right, ONE punch key, cover / HUD / over card; WASD + Space + X/C + Enter on a keyboard) · skins tab.
- **Kaya's T-pose was the converter, not her rig (resolved 2026-09-13).** Every clip put her in a T-pose while her
  bones carried the clip's quaternions — because the bones the clip drove were not the bones the mesh was bound to.
  FBXLoader→GLTFExporter writes a multi-mesh character with a COPY chain of every bone per skinned mesh
  (`mixamorigLeftArm` › `mixamorigLeftArm` › …, identity transforms, under the real bone); Three's GLTFLoader
  de-dupes the names in skin-load order, so the plain `mixamorigLeftArm` the track resolves to was a leaf copy of
  the body skin and the real bone never moved. 32 of 105 library characters (Kaya, Louise, Sophie among the
  bundled 11) had it. Fix: `pipeline/collapse-bones.mjs` inside `retex.mjs` re-points every skin joint to the
  level-0 bone and drops the copies; assets rebuilt. Blackout ships **Arissa** as the free default (bundled) and
  lists 11 skins, Kaya at 20.
- **A stored skin id that left the list must fall back** (`skinById`), or the stage 404s on `../afterdark/assets/kaya.glb`.
- **Clips are the real Mixamo set (2026-09-13)**, exported through the API with no UI (`pipeline/export-clips.mjs`,
  Forward Running Jump `124490901` (45 KB), Cross Punch `90009` (31 KB, whole clip — no window), Death Falling
  Forwards `128670935` (100 KB, `hold` = clampWhenFinished, the mixer's `finished` ignores it so the body stays down),
  idle = the breathing idle. Skeleton-only FBX → `clip.mjs` → clip-only GLB; swapping a file swaps the move.
- **SwiftShader here: 7–8 fps**, dt clamped to 0.05 → the run reads 1.5 m/s (4.4 × 0.37): a software artefact, the
  simulation is consistent. Real fps comes from the S25 via `report("stage.fps")` at frame 720 (`vps/logs.sh blackout`).
- **The farm's haptic check taps the first key before e2e** → the punch counter test is relative (`n0 + 1`).
- **a11y:** `text-warning` on the skin price fails contrast in both themes; ink is `text-base-content`, the lock is
  on the avatar (`opacity-40 grayscale`), never on the card.
- Debug handles: `globalThis.__blackout` (mixer/actions/current/rig/fps/world/holder), `__blackoutEnv` (move/cam).
- Eye: `~/blackout-shots/{run,over}.png`.

## Ф0 — proven on the see pod (2026-09-13, `bash vps/drive.sh blackout --anon --see`)

- **Rapier loads with no bundler.** `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat@0.14.0` from esm.sh (`x-esm-path:
  /@dimforge/rapier3d-compat@0.14.0/es2022/rapier3d-compat.mjs`, HTTP 200 measured with curl) imported by full
  URL in `stage.js`, `await RAPIER.init()`; the DOM readout went `data-phys="ready"` 3.0 s after navigation.
- **Autostep is the vault for low furniture.** Kinematic position-based body + capsule (radius 0.3, half-height
  0.5), `createCharacterController(0.02)`, `enableAutostep(0.5, 0.2, true)`, `setMaxSlopeClimbAngle(50°)`,
  `enableSnapToGround(0.3)`. Auto-run at 2.6 m/s toward −z through `STREET`: the 0.3 step at z −4 was climbed
  (feet y 0.31 at z −3.6), the 0.45 kerb at z −8 was climbed (y back to 0.02 at z −9.3), the 1.0 crate at
  z −12 STOPPED her at z −11.17 (crate face −11.5 + capsule radius 0.3 = −11.2). Gravity is ours: `vy` is
  integrated per frame and zeroed on `computedGrounded()`.
- **afterdark's retarget carries over.** `hipsOf` + prefix rename + hips translation scaled by bind height
  (`dancers.js`), plus IN PLACE: the hips' x/z pinned to frame 0 so a clip never drags the character off its
  physics body. The Running Man dance stood in for a run clip; the breathing idle is afterdark's `clip-idle.glb`.
- **The floor is the physics, not the feet.** afterdark lifts the root so the lower foot touches y=0 every
  frame — by construction that flattens a jump into a slide (its own RESEARCH.md says so). Here the model hangs
  under the capsule with a ONE-TIME bind-pose offset (`root.position.y = -box.min.y`); a jump is a vertical
  velocity the controller resolves.
- **Follow camera = afterdark's orbit re-centred.** `env.cam {yaw, pitch, zoom}` eased from `camT` (drag →
  yaw/pitch, pinch → zoom); position = chest + R·(sin yaw·cos pitch, sin pitch, cos yaw·cos pitch), yaw 0 =
  behind the runner, lerp 0.18 per frame. The shot (384×832): the runner seen from behind, facing the crate.
- The see pod renders in software (~10 fps in the readout) — it proves correctness, never performance. FPS is
  read from the S25 Ultra after the first deploy (`report("stage.fps")`, `vps/logs.sh`).

## The stack (standard first)

- three 0.171 + `three/addons/` — the core's import-map union (1.2.68). GLTFLoader + DRACOLoader (gstatic 1.5.7).
- **Rapier** (`@dimforge/rapier3d-compat`): the official three.js `physics_rapier` example is the precedent; the
  character controller is Rapier's own (`KinematicCharacterController`), used directly — three's
  `RapierPhysics.js` addon only wraps rigid bodies. Product rule: the bare specifier joins the core's UNION (a
  full URL in an app is the probe's shortcut, not the farm's idiom). See the validated API notes below.
- `runtime/dpad.js` (bit mask + `data-act` momentary keys) for the punch key; the joystick is a NEW core element
  (an analog vector — the deck's mask has 8 directions, a 3D runner with an orbit camera needs 360°).
- Cast: afterdark's 11 Draco GLBs (same skeleton, hips prefix differs on Louise). Clips: clip-only GLBs exported

## The world — a street grammar, not tiles (design, to be measured in Ф1)

Segments (straight 24 m, bend, 90° turn, crossing, overpass, tunnel), 8–12 m wide, born 3 ahead of the
runner and freed 2 behind (`world.removeCollider`, geometry disposed). Districts of 400–800 m (centre, blocks,
industrial, waterfront, park, old town) with 100 m blends; neighbours chosen from a sensible adjacency, not
at random. One seed per run; the daily run's seed is the date. Obstacles and coins are placed in 24 m phrases
(run-up → obstacle → coin arc → enemy), density rising with distance. Fog at 80 m hides the edge of the world.
Z-Image (1024² only — no equirect skybox) paints FACADE textures per district into a library; the sky is
procedural. The Blackout: a plane of darkness behind the runner whose speed grows with distance; lights inside
it dim to zero (material emissive → 0, fog colour → black).

## The state map

- `data-phys`: loading | ready | failed | skipped (gate). `data-why` names the failure (rapier: … | glb: …).
- `data-frame`, `data-x/y/z` (feet), `data-grounded` — the readout the driver and e2e assert on.
- Under the gate (`?mock` / localhost) the stage is SKIPPED (WASM + Draco + GLBs over CDNs flake CI); every
  meaning stays in the DOM.

## Open (must be answered before Ф1 code)

- Where the cast lives: cross-app `../afterdark/assets/` works on the deployed site (same origin) but escapes
  blackout's service-worker precache; a farm-level shared `cast/` needs a copy rule in `deploy/build.mjs`.
- The run/vault/punch clip set — on the box.

## Rapier — the validated notes (research pass 2026-09-13; every load-bearing line re-checked by hand)

How each was validated: **[curl]** = a command run from this phone and its output; **[pod]** = the probe measured
on the see pod; **[doc]** = a rapier.rs page or rapier.js source the researcher opened, quoted verbatim, and
whose claim the probe's behaviour agrees with.

- **Version and delivery.** npm latest `0.20.0` (2026-08-08); esm.sh serves it (`x-esm-path
  /@dimforge/rapier3d-compat@0.20.0/es2022/rapier3d-compat.mjs`), module 2 855 162 B, ≈1.08 MB gzip,
  `cache-control: immutable`; the WASM is a base64 literal inside (≈2.0 MB) instantiated with
  `WebAssembly.instantiate`, no fetch. [curl: registry, esm.sh HEAD, `wc -c`, grep of the module text —
  `createCharacterController` / `enableAutostep` / `setNextKinematicTranslation` / `intersectionPairsWith` /
  `removeCollider` all present]. The probe re-driven on 0.20.0 gave the same stop at z −11.18 [pod]. Use
  nothing older: the 0.18.0 changelog fixes a crash when colliders are removed in insertion order — exactly
  what freeing street chunks does [doc: CHANGELOG].
- **Init.** `const RAPIER = await import(url); await RAPIER.init();` — both `default` and the named
  `init`/`World`/`ColliderDesc` are exported [curl: module tail; pod].
- **The controller** (`KinematicCharacterController`, [doc: class page + character_controller_setup]):
  `world.createCharacterController(offset)` (metres, the gap to the environment; guide 0.01, demo 0.1 —
  never 0); `enableAutostep(maxHeight, minWidth, includeDynamicBodies)` (metres; demo 0.7/0.3);
  `setMaxSlopeClimbAngle(rad)`, `setMinSlopeSlideAngle(rad)`; `enableSnapToGround(metres)`;
  `computeColliderMovement(collider, desiredTranslationDelta)` — a PER-FRAME translation in metres, not a
  velocity; then `computedMovement()` / `computedGrounded()`, valid only after that call in the same frame.
  Translation only: "does not support rotational movement" — facing is ours (`holder.rotation.y`).
- **Order per frame** [doc: testbed Testbed.ts 146/150; pod]: controller → `body.setNextKinematicTranslation
  (translation + movement)` → `world.step()`. The step derives the kinematic body's velocity from the next
  position, which is what pushes dynamic bodies later (enemies knocked down).
- **Gravity is ours** [doc: "it is up to you to emulate gravity by adding a downward component"; pod]:
  `vy += g·dt` in the air, `vy = 0` when `computedGrounded()`, a jump = `vy = jumpSpeed` when grounded.
- **Capsule** [doc: colliders]: `ColliderDesc.capsule(halfHeight, radius)`, principal axis Y — three's up,
  no rotation; origin at the CENTRE, so the Mixamo model (origin at the feet) hangs at
  `y − (halfHeight + radius)` [pod: feet at y 0.02 on flat ground].
- **Chunks** [doc: world.ts 629–637]: `world.removeCollider(collider, true)` (always `wakeUp: true`),
  `world.removeRigidBody(body)` removes its colliders and joints too. Broad-phase since 0.18 no longer
  rebuilds its structure every frame — static chunks are cheap to keep [doc: CHANGELOG].
- **Coins** [doc: advanced_collision_detection_js, World.html]: `ColliderDesc.setSensor(true)` on the coin;
  after `world.step()` poll `world.intersectionPairsWith(playerCollider, (other) => …)` — no event queue, no
  `ActiveEvents` flag, no handle→object map. UNKNOWN until measured on device: whether a kinematic-vs-static
  sensor pair needs `setActiveCollisionTypes`.
- **Cost**: no published JS step-time numbers (UNKNOWN). Measure on the S25 with `world.profilerEnabled =
  true; world.timingStep()` (ms of the last step) and `timingCollisionDetection()` [doc: World.html].
- **three's own `RapierPhysics.js` (r171) is NOT the path** [curl: the esm.sh build imports
  `https://cdn.skypack.dev/@dimforge/rapier3d-compat@0.12.0`; doc: 240 lines, rigid bodies only, no
  controller/sensors/removal]. The precedent we keep from it is the idea (Rapier under three); the calls
  are Rapier's own.
- **CSP**: WASM compilation needs `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in `script-src` where a CSP exists; production sends
  NO Content-Security-Policy header [curl: `dreamstudio.mooo.com/afterdark/`, 0 lines]. Re-check inside the
  Android shell's WebView before the APK flavour.
