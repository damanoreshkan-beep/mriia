Our lens into Shodan plus the path between our node and anywhere. Three tool tabs over one key that lives
on the edge (`edge/shodan.js`, `edge/net.js` in microspec-edge). Accent `#F5B94D` — the beam.

## Facts (measured 2026-09-25, `GET /api-info`, no credit spent)
- Plan `edu`, `query_credits 0`, `scan_credits 62648`, `monitored_ips 0`. `/api-info` is free; every page of
  `/shodan/host/search` costs one query credit → the live map is blocked until the balance is topped up, and
  the edge answers `{error:"no_query_credits"}` for it. The globe therefore plots `fixture.json` and says so.
- A browser cannot traceroute; every edge process exits through the VPN, so a trace leaves from OUR node
  (`from:"vpn"`) and the page names that origin instead of pretending it is the phone's path.
- Signed-in routes raise the runtime's authwall on a 401. A tab must not open the wall by merely being
  opened: the state card fetches only when `session` is set; the trace runs on a tap (a gesture), so a 401
  there is the wall doing its job.
  with Monitor; it is not wired and is NOT shown — a tab with a dead top-up button fails the premium bar.

## State map

| Tab · state | Stage | Island / controls | Primary verb | Demotes at 412×430 · 360×340 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| map · live refused | fixture stays | status line names the reason (`creditsWarn` / `noKey`) | — | same |
| map · picked | spin stops, point pulses, globe flies | host panel above the island: ip · port · org · place, × closes | × | panel stacks; still one column |
| state · fixture | — | `sample` chip, warning panel when query credits = 0, two panels of rows | — | rows stay one column |
| state · live | — | chip gone, numbers from `/feed/shodan/info`, `data-live` | — | same |
| path · running | — | button disabled, `data-busy` | — | same |
| path · failed | — | status line `traceFail` under the island; fixture stays | Трасувати again | same |

Precedents: the globe consumer is `apps/globe` (`view.js`, its `e2e.spec.mjs` seeds on `canvas`); the
signed-in fetch shape is `apps/blackout` (wallet); the Island-with-Segmented shape is the kit's own.
