# reel — dive navigation, grouped sources, in-tab liked feed (research note)

The recipe the build follows. Numbers/idioms here are the contract; the code points back at this file.

## 1. The dive (swipe a reel → its page becomes the next source)

VPS extractor return **similar videos from that page** (`feed-core.mjs` `parseVideos` in microspec-edge → nearest-anchor
`item.page`). So the dive target is exactly `item.page` — never `item.video` (a raw mp4 is `not an html page`
and returns `{items:[]}`), never `item.orig`.

Dive is therefore *not* a new capability — it is `openSource(item.page)` plus **navigation state**.

### Frame stack (the "don't lose my place" requirement)
A dive must be reversible **without refetching**: back returns the exact `items` array and the exact slide.
So each dive pushes a **frame** = `{src, items, next, active, eph, owner, loading, err, label}`; back pops it
and restores the atoms wholesale. Scroll is restored as `active × clientHeight` — exact, because every slide
is `h-[100dvh]` under `snap-mandatory` (no measurement needed, no layout race).

Guard: an in-flight *append* (`loadSource(next, true)`) from the previous source must never land in the new
feed → a module `gen` counter invalidates a stale append.

### Back must be systemic, not app-local
The farm invariant is "every dismissable state is history-backed, routed through a runtime atom". A dive
stack is N *sibling* levels, and the runtime's overlay list was strictly one-entry-per-atom, so a stack could
not be expressed. Fix (additive, in the runtime): **`S.stack`** — an array atom whose **length is its history
depth** (`store.overlayDepth`). `index.js` now sums `overlayDepth` per overlay instead of counting booleans,
so Back pops **one** level. Placed **bottom-most** in the overlay order: any sheet/detail/confirm opened on
top closes before a dive level pops. Existing apps never set it → depth 0 → zero behaviour change.

The app never calls `history.*`: pop = `S.stack.set(stack.slice(0,-1))`, and a single `S.stack` listener
restores frames whenever `stack.length < frames.length` — so the swipe, the on-screen back button and the
system Back all take **one** path.

### The drag (feel)
`usePanX` (runtime) already does finger-following with 1:1 tracking to 130px then a 0.35 rubber-band, axis
lock at 6px, and it swallows the click a drag would otherwise fire (so a drag never also likes/pauses).
Reused as-is on the scroller with `touch-pan-y` (browser keeps vertical scroll, we get horizontal).
- drag **left** (`onNext`) → dive (forward/deeper). drag **right** (`onPrev`) → back. iOS convention.
- `threshold: 64` (up from 52) — a full-screen action deserves a firmer commit than a card flick.
- Added `onDrag(dx)` to `usePanX` (optional, additive): lets a caller paint the destination *under* the pane
  as it moves. Here: an underlay revealed at `opacity = min(1, |dx|/110)` showing the destination's identity
  (favicon + `pageLabel`) on the side the drag reveals — right half for the dive, left half for back.
- Commit haptic `vibrate(10)` (a gesture is not a tap → the systemic delegated haptic doesn't cover it).

### Gesture must not be the only way (a11y + gate)
There is no drag helper in the e2e surface (`browser-lib.mjs`: tap/click/back/type/…), and a gesture-only
navigation is inaccessible anyway. Every dive/back is therefore also a **button**: `[data-dive]` (chip on the
slide) and `[data-feed-back]` (in the source island) — which is what the gate exercises.

## 2. Source titles + domain grouping

`packages/runtime/sitelabel.js` (pure, unit-tested — no network, no page fetch):
- `registrableDomain(host)` — public-suffix heuristic with a small multi-label set (`co.uk`, `com.ua`, …) so
  `commons.wikimedia.org` and `wikimedia.org` group together as **one** domain.
- `siteName(url)` → `Mixkit`, `Wikimedia`, `Dareful` (first label of the registrable domain, capitalised).
- `pageLabel(url)` → the readable page title **derived from the URL**, in priority order:
  1. a resolvable search term (`…/search?q=cats` → `cats`) via `urlquery.resolveSearch`;
  2. else the last meaningful path segment, skipping numeric/id/noise segments (`page`, `index`, `2`, …),
     stripping a file extension, a `Category:`/`Tag:` prefix (Wikimedia) and a leading numeric id;
  3. else `siteName`.
  Then `-_+` → spaces, collapse, sentence-case, cap **42 chars** on a word boundary + `…`.
  `…/free-stock-video/space/` → `Space`; `…/wiki/Category:Underwater_videos` → `Underwater videos`.
- Deriving beats fetching: no `<title>` round-trip per row, works offline, deterministic in the gate.

**Layout.** Sources are grouped into **domain cards** (`groupByDomain`), because a domain now accumulates
pages as you dive+subscribe. A group of **1** renders as a single compact row (a header + one child would be
a duplicated line); **2+** renders a header (logo · site name · domain · count · open-site) over hairline-
separated page rows carrying only `pageLabel` + a state dot (primary = currently playing). The raw URL is
gone from the row — that is what "everything fits" means.

## 2b. Naming the page you dived INTO (the "View video" defect)

Deriving a title from the URL (§2) is right for a *list* page and useless for a *video* page — which is
exactly what a dive lands on. Measured shapes: `/view_video.php?viewkey=…` → **"View video"**,
`/video81234567/` → "Video81234567", `/12345678` → the site name. The island, the dive chip, the drag-reveal
and the saved subscription all wore one of those.

Three producers, and none of them is right on its own:

| producer | good at | useless at |
|---|---|---|
| `pageLabel(url)` — the URL | category/tag/search pages (`/space/` → "Space"), offline, free | video pages: their path is a shape |
| the page's own `<title>`/`og:title` (new: `/feed/videos` returns `title`) | video pages | front pages — an SEO sentence ("Free Stock Video & Footage \| No Watermark") |
| the clip you dived FROM (`item.title`) | instant, no fetch, exactly the destination's name | tube grids, where extraction often only has the humanised filename ("preview 1080p") |

So the runtime got **one** resolver, `sitelabel.sourceTitle(url, {pageTitle, hint})`, and the app has no
titling logic of its own:

1. `pageLabelInfo(url)` now reports **`weak`** as well as `label`. Weak = the path exists and still named
   nothing: every token is a medium-word (`view`, `video`, `watch`, `preview`, `clip`…), a bare number, or a
   letters+digits blob (`abC123`, `ph5f2a1b`). A **bare root is NOT weak** — a front page really is its site,
   and that is what keeps the SEO sentence off the island.
2. Not weak → the URL wins. Nothing overrules it.
3. Weak → `cleanPageTitle(pageTitle, url)`, which strips only a **leading/trailing** chunk that names the
   site ("… - TUBE.EXAMPLE", "Mixkit · …") — never an inner one, so "A day - and a night - in Kyiv" survives —
   and returns `""` if what's left is itself weak.
4. Then the hint (same cleaning, so a filename-title is rejected too), then the weak label, so the island
   never goes blank or shows a placeholder while the new feed loads.

The hint is what makes the dive feel instant: `diveTo(S, url, item.title)` names the destination *before* the
fetch, and the page's own title replaces it when `/videos` answers. The title is part of the frame snapshot,
so Back restores the name with the list.

Server side (`microspec-edge`, `core.js`): `pageTitle(html)` = og:title → twitter:title → `<title>`, returned
**raw** — stripping site chrome needs the site's name, and that judgement belongs in the unit-tested runtime,
not in the extractor.

Verified against the private repo's saved page fixtures; the real hosts/titles live in a **gitignored**
`packages/runtime/sitelabel.local_test.js`, and the committed suite carries the same shapes on neutral hosts.

## 2c. The same name on every screen — decode, then room (the sources-list defect)

The island was right and the sources list was wrong about the *same page*, in three separate ways. All three
were measured browser-free against the shipped code before anything was changed:

| symptom in the sources list | cause | measurement |
|---|---|---|
| `Big%20Buck%20Bunny`, `Rock &amp; Roll` | a page name arrives as **machine text** — a path is percent-encoded, a scraped `<title>` still carries entities. The extractor decodes one short named list (`&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&#39;`…) and nothing numeric; nothing decoded the URL path except one bare `decodeURIComponent` | `sourceTitle("…/clip/%2520double%2520encoded/")` → `"%20double%20encoded"` |
| a row **vanished**, or the whole tab went blank | `decodeURIComponent` throws `URIError` for the **entire string** over one bad escape — and a literal `%` in a path is a bad escape | `sourceTitle("https://tube.example/a-100%-sure-thing/")` → *throws* |
| the row's name ≠ the island's name | a subscription's name is **frozen** at subscribe time. Subscribe from the add-URL sheet and the row keeps a guess made from the URL alone, forever — while the island, handed the page's own `<title>` a second later, shows the real name | `subscribe({name: sourceTitle(url)})` vs `$srcTitle` after `/videos` answers |
| a name ending in `…` with half a line spare | the caps are the **producers'** (42 from a URL, 64 from a page title) and no caller could state its own room | `sourceTitle(vid, {pageTitle: <88 chars>})` → 39 chars + `…` |

Fixes, in the layer each belongs to:

1. **`sitelabel.humanText(raw)`** — the one decoder, applied where text *enters* a label (never at render, which
   is how two screens disagree). Percent-decode that never throws: try the whole string, and on `URIError` fall
   back to decoding each **run** of valid escapes on its own (runs, because a multi-byte character is several
   `%XX` together), so a malformed escape costs only itself. Twice at most — `%2520` → `%20` → `" "` — and the
   second pass only if the first left something encoded. Then entities: a named table plus **generic numeric,
   decimal and hex** (that is where the extractor's list ran out), an unknown entity left as it came. Then
   control characters, zero-widths, whitespace collapse.
   Applied in `prettify` (every URL-derived label), per **path segment** after the split (decoding the whole
   path first would let `%2F` invent a separator), and at the top of `cleanPageTitle`.
2. **`renameSub(url, title)`** — the frozen name is corrected the moment the page answers. `setSrcTitle` is the
   single place a source's name is decided: it writes the atom the island reads *and* the subscription row,
   from one string. Costs one IndexedDB write, no round-trip, since a source resolves its title on every load.
3. **`sourceTitle(url, {…, max})`** — room is the **caller's** to state, and overrides both producers with the
   same number so the two truncations cannot disagree. Omitted, each keeps the cap it always had.
4. **The row wraps.** `ROW_MAX = 120` (~2½ lines at 384 px) and no `truncate`: a list row is the one surface with
   room for a whole name, where the island is a chip beside four controls and has to cut. `break-words` only for
   the pathological unbroken token, whose alternative is a horizontal overflow.

Gate: `GATE_TITLES` seeds the mock page title as machine text (`"Big%20Buck%20Bunny in 4K &amp; Friends — Mixkit"`),
so a real browser proves the decode on the path a title actually travels; `GATE_SUBS` seeds two subscriptions,
because everything above "Discover" — the one row shape whose name comes from the *saved title* — had only ever
been measured empty. The e2e compares the row to the island **string for string** (a substring match would have
passed throughout the defect) and then measures `scrollWidth ≤ clientWidth`: `innerText` is identical under
`truncate`, so only geometry can say the name is shown in full.

## 3. Subscribe from the reel
Diving lands on a source you may not have. The island (top, glass, only when `depth > 0` **or** the current
source is unsubscribed) carries: back chevron · favicon · **`sourceTitle`** (§2b) · host · **`+`**.
Subscribing makes the `+` disappear (state is the feedback — no toast, no caption) and **freezes that title**
into the record, so the Sources tab lists the page by the name it had when you saved it.

## 4. Liked tab opens the feed *in place*
`playAt` pushes a frame labelled "Liked" and sets `$owner = "liked"`; the liked view renders the **same**
`FeedSurface` instead of the grid. Back (system or button) pops the frame → `$owner` returns to `"reel"` →
the grid is back, and the source feed underneath is restored untouched. Diving *inside* the liked feed keeps
`$owner === "liked"`, so the drill-down stays in the Liked tab. One engine, one stack, no tab switch.

## 5. Gate fixtures
The gate never touches the network, so `loadSource` under `gate` serves a deterministic batch **per URL**:
`MOCK` (6 seeded → 3 after dedupe/black/flat filters) for the default source, `MOCK_DEEP` (2, titles
`Deeper …`) for anything else — which is what makes dive/back provable in CI. `$likes` is seeded with 2
records under the gate so the Liked tab is measured **populated** (and the in-tab feed is testable without a
double-tap, which the e2e surface cannot dispatch inside the 260 ms `useTap` window).

## 6. Playback continuity — why the swipe blinked, and what the platform actually guarantees


**The cause is structural, not cosmetic.** `Slide` mounted `VideoLayer` only when the slide was `active`, so a
swipe *destroyed* one `<video>` and *built* another: new element → new connection → wait for `loadeddata` →
first frame. Between the old element leaving and the new one having a pixel there is genuinely nothing to
display. No styling closes that gap; only removing the teardown does.

**The fix:** a window of `PRELOAD = 1` slides either side keeps a live element, so the next clip has been
buffering while you watched the current one. Attach and play are separate effects — the element is built once
per clip URL and never rebuilt for a change of `active`, which is the entire point.

### What the specs guarantee (researched before building; Codex read, claims re-checked here)

- **`preload` is a HINT, not an instruction.** WHATWG states a UA may ignore the value entirely on user
  preference or connectivity, and may suspend the download at any time
  ([spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#attr-media-preload)). Chrome's own guidance says
  `auto` is downgraded to `metadata` on cellular and to `none` under Data Saver
  ([web.dev](https://web.dev/articles/fast-playback-with-preload#video_preload_attribute) — note this article
  is old; treat it as evidence the downgrade EXISTS, not as today's exact rule).
  **Therefore `preload="auto"` alone cannot be the mechanism** — on a phone, the one device this is for, it is
  the case most likely to be downgraded. Metadata is not a picture.
- **So the first frame is forced, not requested.** A muted `play()` needs no gesture
  ([WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/)); a neighbour takes one and gives it
  straight back, then rewinds. That decodes frame 0 — the thing actually needed — regardless of how the hint
  was treated. An interrupted `play()` rejects; that is expected and swallowed.
- **A paused element does show its frame once it has one.** After `loadeddata` (`readyState ≥ 2 =
  HAVE_CURRENT_DATA`) the element renders the frame at the current position; before that it is transparent
  black unless a `poster` is set ([rendering](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#the-video-element),
  [ready states](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#ready-states)). Hence `poster` on the
  element itself. Caveat, verified: the show-poster flag is cleared by the play() steps, so `poster` covers
  the *load*, not the moment of starting.

### What is UNKNOWN, and what that decided

- **There is no documented cap on concurrent media elements.** Android's `getMaxSupportedInstances()` is
  described by Android itself as a *hint* for an upper bound that real resources may undercut
  ([Android](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodecInfo.CodecCapabilities#getMaxSupportedInstances())),
  and Chrome documents nothing at the web layer. Worse, **nothing specifies what happens at the limit** — not a
  dropped `src`, not a rejected `play()`, not a `MediaError`.
  → A budget whose failure mode is undefined is one to stay well inside: `PRELOAD = 1`, three elements.
- **Two `<video>`s with the same `src` are not guaranteed to share one transfer.** The HTML fetch model is
  per-element and byte ranges are implementation-defined; HTTP caches are permitted but never obliged to reuse
  a response ([RFC 9111 §2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html#section-2)).
  → The ambient backdrop copy (a second element on posterless clips) is **active-slide only** and waits for the
  main video to have data. It used to start in parallel, which made the clip you are actually watching arrive
  later. At three slides it would also have meant six decoders.
- **hls.js keeps `backBufferLength: Infinity` by default** — every played second retained for the instance's
  life. Survivable at one player; not at three. `/_rt/video.js` now caps it at 30s. (`maxBufferLength` is a
  minimum *target* hls.js reaches regardless of `maxBufferSize`, so the duration cap is the one that binds.)

**Not verified here, and only the phone can settle it:** whether three elements is comfortably inside the real
decoder budget on the target device, and how much of the next clip actually buffers on a cellular connection.
Both are device/network-dependent and the specs decline to say.

## 6. A site's SESSION — your front page, not the server's (2026-08-18)

**The defect.** The root of a site you are signed in to, pasted as a source, came back as somebody else's front
page: the VPS is *one anonymous visitor for everyone* — a datacenter IP with one shared `cookieJar` per host
(`microspec-edge` `core.js`) — and a front page's "recommended" is the visitor's account and history. Nothing
in the extractor could fix that; the fetch had to carry the client's session. (There is no iframe on the
client any more — the reverse-proxy view was removed for never rendering through the datacenter IP.)

**Why the cookie goes to the VPS and not around it.** A page fetch straight from the PWA is CORS-blocked (and
`Referer` is a forbidden header anyway); a shell-side WebView with its own cookie jar would be APK-only and a
Java change. The one party that already fetches the page is the proxy, and the tunnel already exists.

**The recipe.**
- **Edge:** `/feed/videos` takes `POST {url, cookie}` beside the keyless `GET ?url=`. `pageHeaders(src, cookie)`
  — the client cookie wins outright, the shared jar is *not consulted* (mixing would hand one visitor another's
  tracking cookies) and is *never written*. `cleanCookie` = one header line, CR/LF stripped, 8 KB cap. Core
  forwards method+body to the `open` process (both inside the tunnel and on the plain route). Unit-tested on
  `tube.example`; the real host lives in gitignored `core.local_test.js`.
- **Wire:** reel's fetch is already wrapped by `installSealedFetch`, so the JSON body rides inside the sealed
  envelope — the cookie is never in a query string, an nginx log line, or TLS metadata. Verified end-to-end
  through the public URL: plain POST and sealed POST both return the same 22 clips from the probe gallery.
- **App:** `$sessions` (IndexedDB `reelSessions`, keyed by **registrable domain** so root, dive pages and
  `www.`/`m.` share one), a key button on *my* site cards only (a preset has no account) → `SessionSheet`
  (S.screen `"session"`, history-backed) with one field. `loadSource` posts when a session exists, GETs
  otherwise. Empty save = forget, through the undo snackbar. Nothing site-specific in the public repo: the
  owner pastes the site's `/recommended`-style page as a source themselves.
- **Not covered:** `/feed/stream` (the full-clip ladder) still fetches anonymously — the ladder is not personal.
- **Two ways the session still failed to arrive (2026-08-18, evening).** (1) Deno's `fetch(redirect:"follow")`
  drops `Cookie` on any **cross-origin** hop (measured on 2.9: httpbin → httpbin keeps it, httpbin →
  postman-echo loses it), and a bare `site.com` root answers `301 → www.site.com` — so the pasted session
  follows redirects by hand, re-stating the cookie while a hop stays inside one registrable domain (a browser
  sends a domain cookie to every host of the site), dropping it off-site, and `safeUrl`-checking every hop.
  (2) The boot fetch fired from the first mount before IndexedDB had answered, so every **cold start** loaded
  the site anonymously; `loadSource` now awaits `sessionsReady` before reading the cookie.
- **What "the same censored videos every time" actually was (2026-08-19).** Not the cookie, not the parser
  alone: the keyless `open` process egresses through the ExpressVPN tunnel, and its rotator walked all 62 US
  regions — from `usa-sioux-falls` (a state with an adult age-verification law) the site answers its front page
  with an SFW compliance page: 468 KB, `<title>` "Pornhub", 24 podcast clips, no next page. From
  `usa-new-york`: 1.03 MB, 61 clips. The rotator now rotates only through 33 regions in states without such a
  law (`edge/vpn-rotator.sh`). Second, real, defect found on the way: the tiles' poster is an image-proxy URL
  with the clip's filename INSIDE the path (`…/original_<id>.mp4/plain/…`), which the raw sweep read as a second
  video per tile — 82 items, 61 titled "225k <id>", 21 poster-less; `RAW_RX` now requires the extension to end
  the path and `humanName` ignores bitrate tokens (61 clean items). Gitignored local suites carry the real page:
  `edge/core.local_test.js` (ph-root fixture) and `edge/session.local_test.js` (redirect chain, anonymous vs
  cookie, consent flags, egress).

## 7. The black dive, the main list, and where the page is (2026-09-04)

Three reports from the phone, one day: a **black screen** after swiping into a clip; **shorts spliced into the
site's video list**; and a decision about the tap. Measured with the farm's driver (`vps/drive.sh reel …`,
[[reference_drive]]) and fresh phone captures of the site, not from the description.

- **The black dive was two facts, neither of them the swipe.** (1) The edge returned the player's own quality
  ladder — five poster-less, page-less rows titled `mpeg2_ts` — at the TOP of the dive feed, because the phone's
  clip page now renders its rail as `<li>` × 24 plus `<li class="hidden">` × 21 and the two signatures split
  the plurality (take-all). (2) The rail's tile posters answer **403 without a referer and 206 with the
  page's** (curl from the box and from the phone); the client removed the `<img>` on error, and a poster that
  removes itself over a preview is a black slide. The clip path had answered the referer question through the
  sealed proxy since 2026-08; the posters never had. `usePosterSrc` (view.js) now loads a poster the way a clip
  is loaded — direct, once through `sealedFrameUrl` on failure, gone only after a proxied failure — and one
  hook feeds the blurred fill, the sharp fill and the `<video poster>` so the three cannot disagree. The
  liked grid still loads posters direct (a like keeps its poster URL; not in this pass).
- **The main list is the edge's job, and the recipe is written there:** `microspec-edge/docs/research/main-list.md`
  (private repo — real hosts). In one line: records are clustered by KIND (tag + classes minus state words, or a
  JSON entry's shape — key set / arity), the dominant kind is the list; then one kind of PAGE ROUTE must hold ≥ 60 %
  and the rest (`/shorties/<id>`, `/gif/<id>`) go; an ad guard that would take half the list stands down; a
  ladder's rungs dedupe to one clip; an `hdnea` token is a signature. Fields, not counts: the clip page went
  25 (5 junk) → 45 (0 junk), a model page 8 gifs → 19 videos, mixkit/commons/xvideos/redtube byte-identical.
  clip's page — the site's own player, the rest of the page, the comments, the account — and the parse of the
  page's ladder (`/feed/stream`) is a beta that works where it works. So: tap → `openExternal(page)`; the
  island's filled circle is the same trip (external-link glyph, "Відкрити сторінку кліпу" — the keyboard's
  statement of the tap); the More sheet's "Відкрити у браузері" row is REPLACED by "Дивитись тут (бета)" →
  `openFull`. `openBrowser` left both locales; `openPage` and `watchHere` arrived. The e2e proves the pair: a
  tap opens no overlay; the sheet row does, and Back closes it.
  whole ladder (`/feed/stream` → `variants`, so it starts on a 0.5 Mbps rung instead of a pinned 1080p) the
  beta was better than the trip out: the tap now opens OUR player, the island lost its player button, and
  "Відкрити у браузері" is a row in the More sheet. The bullet above is the state it replaced, kept because
  it is the reason the player exists at all.
- **A shortie's page is a player, not a list.** `/shorties/<id>` carries five ladders and names no rail
  (`relatedEndpoint` → null), so a dive into one is "На цій сторінці відео не знайдено" — by design, not a
  defect; the tap opens it on the site. Its rail is the site's JS.
- **The eye cannot decode H.264** (Playwright's Chromium: `canPlayType('video/mp4; codecs="avc1…"')` is
  empty), so `video.error.code === 4` in a drive is the eye, not production; judge the posters and the wire.

## 8. Shared IN — a link another app hands to reel (2026-09-20)

The ask: share a link from any app and have reel take it as a source, without opening reel and typing it.
An *installed* reel is two different apps and the door is different in each; the resolver and the landing
are the same.

**PWA (Chrome / Samsung Internet).** `manifest.json` gains `share_target`: `action: "./"`, `method: "GET"`,
the three Web Share fields mapped onto `sh_title` / `sh_text` / `sh_url`. Android then lists reel in the
system sheet and LAUNCHES the start URL with those keys in the query — no route to add, no service-worker
POST handler, and the precached `./` answers it offline (`sw-core` matches with `ignoreSearch`). The keys
are prefixed because `url`, `text` and `title` are names the runtime's own query params (`?tab=`,
`?screen=`, `?mock`, `?__hold=1`) could collide with, and the manifest may map a field onto any key it likes.

**The cost nobody can code around:** a WebAPK's manifest is BAKED at install — the orientation lesson, in
the core repo's `docs/research/webapk-identity.md`. A share target added today reaches an *already
installed* reel only when Chrome re-mints the APK: the app is launched, its manifest has not been checked
for 24 h, and the swap lands while the device is on WiFi, charging, with every window of the PWA closed.

**APK (our own shell).** An Android WebView implements no Web Share in either direction, so `share_target`
means nothing there. The shell's mechanism is the mirror image: every `full` template carries one DISABLED
share activity-alias per kind, and a page turns its own on (`share.target { kinds: ["text"] }`, persisted by
PackageManager across reboots) and then listens on `share.incoming`. reel asks for `text` ONLY — its source
is a page, and a shell answering "share video" would sit in the sheet for every clip in the gallery with
nothing to do with one. No spec change was needed: the edge grants `full` to every APK built from
`https://dreamstudio.mooo.com` (`edge/apk/templates.js`) and `share` is in every full flavour's capabilities.

**The resolver is the whole trick.** Android does not hand over a URL; it hands over up to three strings,
and no two senders fill them the same way — Chrome sends `url`, Telegram a title and a url, TikTok one
`text` with its caption wrapped around the link, and a plain-text share may carry a bare domain. So every
field is scanned for a real `https?://` link first and only then for a bare domain, on the same terms the
add-URL sheet accepts one. Trailing sentence punctuation is stripped (`… https://x.co/a.` is one whitespace
token), and our own origin is skipped: sharing a reel back into reel would load this page as a "source",
which extracts nothing and reads as a bug.

**Landing.** `openAsSource(S, url)` — subscribe, drop the dive stack, load, switch to the reel tab. It is
exactly what the add-URL sheet was already doing inline, now named once: a shared link is a source you did
not have to type. The payload WAITS if it arrives before any view of ours is mounted (a cold start, or a
shell share delivered while the runtime's own profile tab is up), and the first view to render lends the
module its `S` — safe only because `createApp` builds it once per app and never replaces it.

**And it comes off the address.** `replaceState` removes the three `sh_*` keys and nothing else, so a reload
or a restored tab cannot add the same source twice, and the address bar of an installed app does not carry
somebody's caption. The e2e asserts both halves: the source changed, and `sh_` is gone from `baseURI`.

## 9. The island grew two drawers, and the sources tab stopped being a control panel (2026-09-21)

Four asks in one morning, all of them the same complaint from different sides: the app knows things it does
not show, and the screens that should show them are busy with buttons.

**Avatars on every list.** Two defects in the edge, both measured against the live pages and both fixed
there (`microspec-edge`, extract.js): a lazy image states its picture in `data-src` and a 1×1 spacer in
`src`, and the reader stopped at the first attribute that had a value; and an uploader is not always two
path segments deep — the second-biggest source here parks every account at the site root (`/sarablonde`),
which is why 18 of 27 tiles on a search page had no account at all and therefore nothing to fetch a face
for. The app side did not change: it already asked `/feed/avatar` for the accounts a tile names.

**The cast, behind a button.** A listing tile never carries a cast; the clip's own page does. So
`/feed/cast` is a second request, made on tap, cached six hours on the edge — thirty tiles would otherwise
be thirty page fetches for a row most people never open. A face in the row is the same dive as the account
circle beside the title. Two page shapes are read (a labelled row, a marked link) and where a label exists
it wins, because the same page marks every performer of every related clip in the rail beside it.

**Search inside the source.** The runtime could already swap the term in a results URL; what was missing was
a results URL for a source that is a front page or an account. The site's own `<form>` is not the answer —
the biggest source names its field `search_text` while its results live at `/video/search?search=…`, and
the form's name 404s — so the edge reads the pattern out of the links the site PUBLISHES (trending
searches, tag rails, the pager) and hands up one example URL with the feed. The app remembers it per host,
and `buildSearchUrl` does the rest. The island's search button appears only where there is somewhere to
send it.

held five things, so neither of the two new functions is a new circle. Each is a DRAWER: search REPLACES the
row, because an input needs the width the row is using; the cast opens ABOVE it, because you are choosing
between faces and the row you came from should stay put. One at a time, both closed by a swipe to the next
clip — a cast belongs to the clip it was opened on.

that every line was a control panel — up to four icon buttons beside the one thing you came to do. So the
SITE owns the site's actions (open in browser, the session cookie) once in its card header, a PAGE row owns
the one action about that page (keep it or drop it), a site with a single page whose name is the site's own
name is one tap target instead of a header repeating itself, and identity is a face wherever the app has
already learned one — nothing is fetched for this screen. A filter appears at six kept sites and searches
names and hosts. The per-row search came out: the island searches whatever you are watching.

**Noir covers the liked grid.** The flag was raised by the feed and taken off when the feed unmounted, so
the one screen that is nothing but frames — three columns of them, in another tab — stayed in colour. Both
screens raise it now and nothing has to hand it over; it selects only the surfaces that name it
(`[data-reel]`, a dialog's video, `[data-liked] img`), so letting it linger costs nothing.
