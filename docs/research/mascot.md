**Final identity: one character — a small fox of black smoke.** Not a material-shifting shape (the cat,
then mirage's per-material fox, both retired): she IS black smoke, and each theme only lights her its own
way. The prompt contract (validated on the pods; the loose first cut let lum render a RED fox — the
"sculpted ONLY from black smoke, dark charcoal monochrome body, no fur texture, no orange" wording is what
holds her identity):

    a small fox sculpted ONLY from black smoke, dark charcoal monochrome body, no fur texture, no orange,
    frozen mid-swirl, fine volumetric tendrils, the smoke itself forms the fox, no real fox, sitting curled
    with a long flowing smoke tail, calm, full body, centred, plenty of empty space around it, no text
    + the theme's light: lum "on pure black, faint warm amber gold and electric cyan sparks WITHIN the
    smoke" · paper "on pure white paper, charcoal ink-smoke, gilded gold edge glints" · ink "blooming like
    ink in clear water on pure white, fine vermilion wisps" · mercury "on pure black, cold silver glints,
    droplets of liquid chrome caught in the smoke" · plain "plain dark grey studio, neutral grey-black smoke"

Picker thumbs cut by `mascot-tools/fox-thumbs.mjs` (2026-09-02 picks: lum c · paper a · ink a · mercury a ·
plain b). She is also the face of empty states and the store's hero (the `--ds-mascot` hook). History below.

# (history) 2026-09-01: Kotyk-Zirka shipped, then the material fox

**That evening: mirage's curled fox.** The owner saw the cat in the picker and
preferred the fox from mirage's style cards ("мені вона більше подобається"), so the picker's pictures were
the fox masters mirage already had (lum, paper, ink, chrome → mercury) plus a clay fox for Просто, cut by
`docs/research/mascot-tools/fox-thumbs.mjs`. Kotyk-Zirka stays below as a
record; nothing in the product references it.

---

**Earlier pick: Котик-Зірка (candidate 3).** Shipped the same day as the five picker thumbnails
(`rt/theme-<id>.webp`, 384², webp q80 — the same subject through every theme's material, Z-Image-Turbo on
the edge pods via the RAW generator). The prompt contract that produced them:

    a small imaginary chubby cat sitting like a loaf with its paws tucked in, two five-pointed star shaped
    ears on top of its head, a very short tail, a small crescent mark on its chest, eyes shut, faintly
    smiling, full body, centred, plenty of empty space around it, <material block>

where the material block is mirage's style block rephrased so the material FORMS the cat ("…the ink itself
forms the cat, no real cat…" — without it the model puts a photo cat next to the material). Blocks used:
lum / paper / ink / chrome (Mercury) from `apps/mirage/styles.js`; Просто = "a simple smooth matte pale grey
clay figurine, the clay itself forms the cat, no real cat, soft even studio light, minimal, plain dark grey
void". Two takes per theme, picked by eye on a contact sheet (lum a · paper a · ink a · mercury a · plain b).
The recipe is in `docs/research/mascot-tools/`: `jobs.mjs` prints the JOBS json, `genraw.mjs` runs it on the
four pods (`docker exec -i -e JOBS="$J" microspec-edge deno run -A - < genraw.mjs > out`), `collect.mjs`
writes the PNG masters, `thumbs.mjs` cuts the 384px webp into `rt/`. A new theme = one more block in
`jobs.mjs` and one more pick.
Known drift: the star ears hold unevenly (Сяйво renders plain ears with stars around; Ртуть one star ear) —
at a 96px round thumb the silhouette + material carry it; a hero-size render (1024) will want a re-roll
with the ears weighted ("ears that ARE five-pointed stars").

Original proposal, kept for the record:

The mascot is the ONE subject rendered through every material (mirage's fox, replaced): the thumbnail of
each theme card in the profile's picker, and later the face of empty states and the store's hero. It must
read at 96px (a card thumbnail) and at 1024px, in eleven materials, in both modes — so the SILHOUETTE
mascot.md` becomes the prompt contract and the thumbnails are generated on the edge pods through the RAW
generator (never `rerun.mjs`, which appends the luminous block to every job).

## 1 · Lumka (Лумка) — the lantern cat

A small, compact cat with oversized ears whose tips fray into soft luminous tufts, a long tail ending in a
lantern-like bulb it curls around its paws, calm half-closed eyes. Sits upright, curled slightly, like a
question mark. The tail-bulb is the one detail every material keeps (a bulb of light, a paper lantern, a
chrome sphere, a sand hill with a glowing top…). Silhouette: round body + two big ears + a hooked tail.

## 2 · Vetra (Ветра) — the moth-cat

A lean cat with two pairs of ears set like moth wings, a ruff of fine filaments around the neck, a tail that
splits into three thin ribbons trailing behind, eyes like two crescents. In motion, mid-leap. Silhouette:
long diagonal body + a wing-shaped head + three ribbons. Reads dramatic at 1024, harder at 96.

## 3 · Kotyk-Zirka (Котик-зірка) — the star-eared

A chubby short cat with five-pointed star ears, a very short tail, and a chest mark shaped like a small
crescent; sits like a loaf with the paws tucked in, eyes shut, faintly smiling. Silhouette: a loaf with two
stars on top — the simplest to read at any size, the most "brand" (a star-eared loaf is instantly ours).

## The prompt contract (whichever wins)

Subject line (constant): "a small imaginary cat, <silhouette phrase>, sitting curled, calm half-closed
eyes, full body, centred, plenty of empty space around it, no text". Then mirage's style block for the
material (apps/mirage/styles.js), then: "the creature itself is made of that material — no real cat, the
material forms the shape". Ground per mode as the ds-sprites: pure black for night, pure white for day (so
alpha is exact math through `ds-import`). One master per material at 1024, thumbnails at 384 (webp q80).

## Where it goes

- `rt/theme-<id>.webp` — the picker thumbnail (the mascot in that material).
- later: the empty state's figure and the store's hero (a systemic hook, like the theme art).
